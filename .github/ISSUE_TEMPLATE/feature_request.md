**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always
frustrated when [...]

**Describe the solution you'd like**
The ability to add a timer to the screen that is not browser loadin specific, but stored on the server, so when you start and stop this, all streams will see the same time.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
The ability to have a timer, that can be hidden and shown using the !timeron @timeroff command
The ability to !starttimer !stoptimer !pausetimer   (!starttimer will always reset, !pausetimer will be an on off swtich)
The ability for all viewers to see the same time available, so a browser refresh will not start the counter again

**Additional context**
There is already a timer in general, but this only works as a local resource and will show different times for all the viewers.
